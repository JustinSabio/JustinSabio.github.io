                            <p><br>“Siddhartha has a very professional and down-to-earth approach to voice acting. He shows true passion for bringing the characters he voices to life, and went the extra step in creating a performance that expanded on the
                                script and character materials he was provided. Siddhartha took direction well and was willing to experiment along with the director during recording sessions. We at Circean Studios are excited to share his performance
                                in Konsui Fighter as Itami, and look forward to the opportunity to work with him again on future projects!” - Shayne Helms, Director, Circean Studios<br></p>

                            <p>Bask in the hilariousness of this animal-themed animation of famillial rivalries and antics! The quick-worded Vincent (played by Siddhartha) can't express enough how much he despises Ace (Mark), and will stop at nothing to
                                ruin and put an end to his excessive, care-free dating! Tangled not only with bubbling dark, ill-intent disguised by facades of friendly help, but also filled with a morbid, sitcom-style humour, this is a skit you won't
                                want to miss out on!<br></p>

                            <p>“We cast Siddhartha in the role of Issen for our project ‘Mizari Loves Company’. Since then, he has done excellent work that has been delivered in a very timely manner, well before our deadlines. We couldn’t be happier with
                                his work. He developed an age-appropriate voice and great British accent to help really make his character blend into the game’s setting, based solely on the short description we gave for the casting call. In addition,
                                from his audition lines to his finished work, he has perfectly emulated the essence of Issen, where others didn’t quite seem to ‘get’ the character.” - Jacqueline Maillet, Director, Reine Works<br></p>
